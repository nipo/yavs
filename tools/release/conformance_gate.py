"""Release gate (#1017): the release waits for the conformance run of its own tag and stops if it is red.

  tools/release/conformance_gate.py wait TAG SHA   # release.yml, tag push: needs GH_TOKEN, GH_REPO, actions: read
  tools/release/conformance_gate.py list SHA       # dry run: show the conformance runs of SHA, never fails on them
  tools/release/conformance_gate.py --selftest

conformance.yml regenerates the report at the tagged commit and, on a tag, fails when the committed
docs/conformance.md differs (the file release.yml publishes). Only that run proves the report belongs
to the release: a run on main passes with a warning when the report is stale.
