Where simulators differ
=======================

The VHDL standard leaves some points open, and simulators do not always agree on them. Where the
standard is clear, yavs follows it and reports a violation early; where it is open, yavs is
permissive. These are the differences you are most likely to run into when you move a design to
yavs, with what to do about each.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 40 30

   * - Situation
     - What yavs does
     - What you can do
   * - A testbench depends on which process runs first in a cycle
     - Runs processes in one fixed order, the same at any ``--threads``.
     - ``--shuffle[=SEED]`` runs another order to find the dependency; pass values through
       signals instead.
   * - Verification code with a shared variable that is not protected, a pure function that calls
       an impure one, or an ``others`` aggregate assigned to an unconstrained object
     - Errors, as the standard says.
     - ``--relaxed`` on ``analyze`` and ``run`` turns them, and the other cases below that name it,
       into warnings.
   * - A PSL ``sequence`` or ``property`` declaration after ``begin``
     - Error ``E1241``: VHDL-2008 makes it a declaration, written before ``begin``.
     - Move it before ``begin``, or pass ``--relaxed`` (warning ``W1241``).
   * - PSL in ``-- psl`` comments
     - Read only when asked.
     - ``--psl`` on ``analyze`` and ``run``.
   * - A TIME literal with a unit below ``--resolution`` (``1 ps`` with ``--resolution=ns``)
     - Error before time 0, also in code that never runs.
     - Use a finer ``--resolution`` (default ``fs``) or write times in coarser units.
   * - Files of different standards in one design
     - Allowed; the design uses the packages of the newest standard.
     - Keep VHDL-1993 code that overloads on both ``std_logic_vector`` and ``std_ulogic_vector``
       in a design of 1993 files only.
   * - A VHDL-1993 file that uses ``=`` on ``std_logic_vector`` with both ``std_logic_1164`` and
       ``std_logic_unsigned`` visible (or any operation declared implicitly by one package and
       explicitly by another)
     - Error ``E1302`` under ``--std=93``: VHDL-1993 hides neither declaration.
     - ``--relaxed`` uses the explicit one, as VHDL-2008 does (warning ``W1302``); or analyze the
       file with ``--std=2008``.
   * - VHDL-1993 code that relies on rules VHDL-2008 relaxed
     - Error ``E1007`` under ``--std=93``, naming the 1993 rule.
     - Analyze the file with ``--std=2008``.
   * - A record or array value whose field or element has another length than its target's, on
       an assignment, a parameter or a qualified expression
     - Error: ``E1405`` when both lengths are static, ``E3009`` at run time otherwise. The value is
       never truncated.
     - Make both sides the same length. A design that passed on another simulator may have
       relied on the truncation: the error names the statement and both lengths.
   * - A named aggregate as an operand of a predefined operator, ``c = (3 => a, 2 => b, ...)``, with
       ``c`` of a constrained array type declared ``downto``
     - The aggregate runs in the direction of the index subtype, so its leftmost element is its
       lowest index, not ``3``. ``others`` there is ``E1325``.
     - Qualify it, ``t'(3 => a, 2 => b, ...)``, to give it the type's direction.
   * - An aggregate target with a nested aggregate as an element of an array of arrays,
       ``((p, q), (r, s)) := m`` with ``m`` an array of rows
     - Error ``E1410``: each element of an aggregate target must be a name. A target of a
       two-dimensional array, and nested record targets, are accepted.
     - Name whole rows, ``(row0, row1) := m``, or assign the elements one by one.
   * - A file that declares the same design unit twice (two architectures ``a`` of ``e``)
     - Warning ``W0005``: the second replaces the first, and a unit between them that names it
       runs with the second.
     - Remove or rename one of the two.
   * - ``T'base`` as a type mark: ``integer'base'(5)``, ``new t'base'(...)``, ``x : t'base``
     - Error ``E1201`` in a VHDL-1993 or VHDL-2008 file: the standard allows ``'base`` only as
       the prefix of another attribute (``t'base'left``). A VHDL-2019 file still accepts it.
     - Name the type directly, ``integer'(5)``.
   * - A statement label with the name of a declaration of the same region: a signal and a process
       label in one architecture, a variable and a loop label in one process, a statement label
       of an entity and a signal of its architecture
     - Error ``E1101``: a label is declared in the enclosing process, subprogram, block, generate,
       architecture or entity, and two declarations in one region may not share a name. A label
       in a nested region only hides the outer name.
     - Rename the label or the declaration.
   * - A declaration with the name ``guard`` in a guarded block: ``b : block (c)`` with a signal,
       generic, port, constant, type, subprogram or alias called ``guard``
     - Error ``E1101``: a guarded block implicitly declares the signal ``GUARD`` (LRM 2008 11.2),
       which an explicit declaration of the same name may not hide. A nested block has its own region.
     - Rename the declaration.
   * - A static index out of range or a constant overflow in code that may be dead
     - Warning (``W1404``, ``W1401``); the check still runs if the code runs.
     - ``-Werror=W1404`` makes it an error.
   * - An external name as the actual of an ``in`` port
     - The port follows the signal in the same delta cycle.
     - Do not depend on the delta in which such a port changes.
   * - ``std_logic_arith``, ``std_logic_unsigned`` and the other Synopsys packages
     - Built into ``ieee`` and visible without a flag.
     - Nothing; prefer ``numeric_std`` in new code.
